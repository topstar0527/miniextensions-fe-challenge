- You should only make 3 API calls to Airtable when a user logs in. This means your app must only make one API call to fetch the class records. 
- You must use filterByFormula to fetch all the classes at once. The same is true for fetching the names of the students within the classes. 
- Submissions that make more than 3 API calls per login will be disqualified.
